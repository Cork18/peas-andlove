# Infected flower inoculation method
## _Flower sterilization_ 
1. Prepare a 0.5% sodium hypochlorite solution in a 50mL beaker (for 20mL, use 2mL of 5% sodium hypochlorite and 18mL of distilled water)
1. Collect non-scenescent flowers from common bean plants in the greenhouse 
1. Disinfect the flowers by submerging in 0.5% sodium hypochlorite solution
1. Allow the flowers to air dry on Kim Wipes before placing onto petri dishes containing S. Sclerotiorum isolate
1. Place petri dishes in incubator at 23C for 48 hours

## _Inoculation Procedure_
1. After incubation for 48 hours, transfer the infected flowers onto a set of trifoliate leaves at the fourth internode of the plant 
1. Track lesions sizes over time
